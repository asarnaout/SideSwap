## Purchased — used under licence, NOT redistributed in this repo

- **london-double-decker.glb** — "Low Poly London Bus" by **LinderMedia**
  (Envato / 3DOcean, TurboSquid product 1381797,
  <https://3docean.net/item/low-poly-london-bus/23371870>), used under a
  purchased Envato Market licence. That licence permits use of the model in the
  game but **not** redistribution of the raw asset, so this `.glb` is
  **gitignored** and never committed to this public repo. If you own the asset,
  regenerate it from your purchased OBJ with
  `node tools/build-london-bus.mjs <path-to/LowPoly-LondonBus_OBJ.obj>`. When the
  file is absent, the game falls back to its procedural double-decker
  automatically. Recoloured to plain London red with no operator/TfL branding.
